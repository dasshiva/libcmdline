libcmdline is a simple library meant for parsing command line options

The library consists of a single C source file (libcmdline.c) and C header
file (libcmdline.h) which can be easily integrated into any project.

It exports four functions namely:
1) ProgramDetails()
2) ParseOptions()
3) GenerateHelp()
4) FreeOptions()

Documentation on these functions and the headers as well as the format
of command line functions accepted by ParseOptions can be viewed by 
reading the comments in both files.

The library is very small (about 400 lines of C source) and you can 
understand its source very quickly. It is not meant to be the fastest of
its kind but it does it job effectively.

The file main.c demonstrates how to use the library and its functions
